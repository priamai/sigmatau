# SigmaTau

## Introduction

Security operation teams have a hard time managing alert volumes and tracking the quality 
of signature detections over time.
The quality of signature and ML based systems can be assessed with a solid mathematical 
framework from 
the field of data science and machine learning.

This standard is an extension to the excellent work of [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) 
which enables security teams to include performance metrics in their signature database.

Please refer to the full paper on our [github](https://github.com/priamai/whitepapers/blob/main/2023/02/10/root_evil_fp.md) or [website](https://www.priam.ai/whitepaper).

## Installation
We have not published on pypi yet so for now.

```
git clone https://github.com/priamai/sigmatau
cd sigmatau
pip install .
```


## Metrics
The metrics available are based on the confusion matrix for binary classifiers.
This relies on the confusion matrix and derived measures: precision, recall, f-measure.

## Schema
The schema is implemented as a pydantic model on YML files.

## Example schema

The example below is the famous Mimikatz detection which contains a good list of false positive typical scenarios.
Below that you can find our field called *metrics* which reports the statistical performance of that signature in different 
anonymized environments represented by their id.

```

The matrix object represents:
* fp = false positive counts
* tp = true positive counts
* fn = false negative counts
* tn = true negative counts

The derived measures are:
* precision
* recall
* F1

The precision format is just a standard way to know the decimal points.

The sample field counts the total events for which the matrix was computed over a period of time.


## Usage
To validate a folder with tau signatures:
```
sigmatau-cli -folder ./tests/rules/tau -t
```

To validate a folder just with the standard sigma signatures:

```
sigmatau-cli -folder ./tests/rules/sigma -s
```

You can then measure some simple stats on the fields.

```
sigmatau-cli -folder ./tests/rules/sigma -s -ss
```

This produces:

## Kestrel resolver

The Kestrel [language](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/) can be used to trigger automatic investigations from an alert to gather additional evidence for the human operator.

We are using ACH to provide an evidence based approach for determination of alerts.

The final DISPLAY step of a hunt flow should produce a table in the following format.

The columns are the hypothesis: 
* TP trupe positive
* FP false positive
* ND not determined (or other).

The rows are the evidence:
* 1 maps positive toward the hypothesis
* 0 maps neutral tward the hypothesis
* -1 maps negative toward the hypothesis

|            | TP | FP | ND |
|------------|----|----|----|
| Evidence 1 | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| Evidence 2 | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| Evidence N | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| Scoring    | 3  | 1  | 0  |

The scoring in this case suggests that this particular investigation is very likely to be a true positive.

The hunt flow files are referenced via the resource directly.
